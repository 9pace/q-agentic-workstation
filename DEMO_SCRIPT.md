### Closing
*"This is just Phase 1. Coming soon: hooks for automation, dependency management, and advanced orchestration. The future of AI-assisted development."*

## Quick Wins to Demonstrate

1. **Speed**: 4 agents complete in ~2 minutes vs 8+ minutes sequential
2. **Visibility**: See everything at a glance vs multiple CLI commands
3. **Control**: Stop/start/view logs without leaving dashboard
4. **UX**: Professional UI vs plain text output
5. **Efficiency**: Auto-refresh vs manual polling

## Comparison Shot

### Before (CLI)
```bash
qaw status
# Wait...
qaw status
# Wait...
qaw status
# Manually check each agent:
qaw logs agent-123
qaw logs agent-456
qaw logs agent-789
```

### After (Dashboard)
```bash
qaw dashboard
# Everything live, all in one view
# Click, press keys, done
```

## Pro Tips for Demo

1. **Pre-load agents**: Have some running before showing dashboard
2. **Use full screen**: Maximize terminal for best effect
3. **Dark theme**: Looks better on video
4. **Slow down**: Let UI animations complete
5. **Highlight**: Point out auto-updates happening

## Common Questions

**Q**: "Does this require a GUI?"
**A**: "No! It's a TUI - works in any terminal, even over SSH."

**Q**: "What about CI/CD?"
**A**: "Use CLI for automation, dashboard for interactive development."

**Q**: "Can I customize it?"
**A**: "Keyboard shortcuts and themes coming in future updates."

**Q**: "Performance with many agents?"
**A**: "Tested with 20+, stays responsive. Updates only what changed."
