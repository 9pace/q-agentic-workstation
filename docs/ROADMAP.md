## Phase 1: MVP - Basic Agent Orchestration
**Status**: ðŸŽ¯ Next
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks

### Goals
- Test Q CLI's delegate capability
- Validate agent coordination patterns
- Prove parallel execution works

### Tasks
1. **Test Existing Agents**
   - Use your existing `task-orchestrator` agent
   - Verify delegate tool works as expected
   - Document any Q CLI limitations

2. **Create Simple Wrapper CLI**
   ```bash
   # Basic qaw command
   qaw submit "task description"
   # -> spawns orchestrator with logging
   ```

3. **Implement Basic State Tracking**
   - Create `.qaw/state/` directory structure
   - Log agent spawns to JSON files
   - Track PIDs and status

4. **Build Simple Status Command**
   ```bash
   qaw status
   # Shows: running agents, their PIDs, start times
   ```

### Success Criteria
- Can spawn orchestrator that delegates to 2+ agents
- Can track which agents are running
- Can view basic status of execution

### Example Test
```bash
qaw submit "Create a login form with API endpoint"
# -> orchestrator spawns frontend-agent and backend-agent
# -> both work in parallel
# -> can monitor via qaw status
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1 Approach: Start Simple

**Week 1: Validation**
```bash
# Day 1-2: Test existing agents
q chat --agent task-orchestrator "test delegation"

# Day 3-4: Basic wrapper script
#!/bin/bash
# qaw-submit.sh
TASK="$1"
q chat --agent orchestrator-agent \
  --no-interactive \
  --trust-all-tools \
  "$TASK" > .qaw/logs/$(date +%s).log 2>&1 &
echo $! > .qaw/pids/agent-$!.pid

# Day 5-7: Status tracking
# Read PIDs, check if running, show info
```

**Week 2: Refinement**
- Add proper error handling
- Improve logging
- Create install script
- Write basic docs

### Tech Stack Recommendations

**Phase 1-3 (Core System)**
- **Language**: Bash/Python (whichever you're more comfortable with)
- **Why**: Simple scripts, good for wrapping Q CLI, easy to iterate

**Phase 4 (TUI)**
- **Option A**: Python + `textual`
  - Pro: Excellent TUI framework, great docs
  - Con: Python dependency
- **Option B**: Go + `bubbletea`
  - Pro: Single binary, fast
  - Con: Steeper learning curve
- **Option C**: Rust + `ratatui`
  - Pro: Performance, safety
  - Con: Longest development time

**Phase 7 (Web)**

## Questions to Resolve in Phase 1

1. **Q CLI Limitations**
   - Does delegate tool work as expected?
   - Can we capture sub-agent outputs?
   - How to track delegated agent PIDs?

2. **State Management**
   - How to know when delegated agent completes?
   - Can we pause/resume Q CLI agents?
   - How to inject messages to running agents?

3. **Coordination**
   - Does orchestrator wait for delegated agents?
   - Can delegated agents communicate?
   - How to handle agent failures?

These will be answered through experimentation in Phase 1.
